### Software Versions ###

Sometimes you will find distro versions hopelessly out of date, but the chances are some kind person will explain how you can use PPA so that you can continue to use graphical tools to install software eg for [jdk8 from Oracle][jdk8] but failing that you could easily manually install jdk8 to say /opt, and use the excellent `update-alternatives` tool on debian to provide symbolic links (and to manage which version is active).

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk{version}/bin/java 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/jruby jruby /opt/jruby{version}/bin/jruby 100
sudo update-alternatives --config java
sudo update-alternatives --config jruby
```

If you absolutely must use `rvm` to install ruby/jruby personally I would avoid it like the plague (unless you are doing rails development it is complete overkill and an absolute pain).

You should prefer to install gems locally (no need for sudo). To do that it is convenient on linux Mint to edit your `~/.profile` file as follows, the important thing is ensure that the gem bin directory is on your path.

```bash
alias jpry="jruby -e \"require 'pry'; binding.pry\""
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/jdk1.8.0_102"
export GEM_HOME="/home/tux/.gem/ruby/2.3.0"
export GEM_PATH="/home/tux/.gem/ruby/2.3.0"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GEM_PATH}/bin"
```

### Optional extra Atom ###

Even if you've been using vim/emacs it might be worth at least giving [atom][atom] a try, if you are coming from Windows you should probably install it!!! Vim/Emacs might come as bit of a shock.

See [website][atom] (or scroll to bottom of [releases page for downloads][releases] on github)

For linux ignore any distro version and download latest version (at least 1.9.0) and:-

```bash
sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb # debian, mint, ubuntu
```
