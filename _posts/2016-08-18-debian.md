### Distro ###

For ease of use you should install the latest version of [Linux Mint 18 Sarah][mint], Cinnamon Edition is modern and clean. Otherwise you might find software versions hopelessly out of date, you can get round it but is is more work.  In general you want the non-free (as in closed source) graphics drivers for `opengl` performance (Mint will likely install them for you).  You will likely want to customise your desktop to include a  `gnome-terminal` launcher (it is much easier to do things from a terminal, eg `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre` than struggle with the gui).

### Required Dependencies ###

Use apt or the gui alternative to install `openjdk-8` runtime, `libopenfx-java` and `libopenfx-jni` (the last two to support FX2D mode). Alternatively install the latest [jdk from Oracle][jdk] (I suggest you unzip the tarball into `/opt`) then use the excellent `update-alternatives` tool on debian to provide the symbolic links (and to manage which version is active).

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk{version}/bin/java 100
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

Similarly you should unpack the [jruby tarball][jruby] to `/opt`  then use the excellent update alternative tool to provide symbolic links to `jruby`, `jgem`, `jirb` etc.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/jruby jruby /opt/jruby{version}/bin/jruby 100
sudo update-alternatives --config jruby
```

If you absolutely must use `rvm` to install ruby/jruby personally I would avoid it like the plague (unless you are doing rails development it is complete overkill and an absolute pain).

You should prefer to install gems locally (no need for sudo). To do that it is convenient on linux Mint to edit your `~/.profile` file as follows, the important thing is ensure that the gem bin directory is on your path.

```bash
alias jpry="jruby -e \"require 'pry'; binding.pry\""
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/jdk1.8.0_102" # if using oracle java
export GEM_HOME="/home/tux/.gem/ruby/2.3.0"
export GEM_PATH="/home/tux/.gem/ruby/2.3.0"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GEM_PATH}/bin"
```
Note editors with their own launcher may not respect this profile (see [script][script])

### Optional extra Atom ###

Even if you've been using vim/emacs it might be worth at least giving [atom][atom] a try, if you are coming from Windows you should probably install it!!! Vim/Emacs might come as bit of a shock.

See [website][atom] (or scroll to bottom of [releases page for downloads][releases] on github)

For linux ignore any distro version and download latest version (at least 1.9.0) and:-

```bash
sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb # debian, mint, ubuntu
```
