# Propane

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-processing/propane.svg?branch=think_open)](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-processing/propane)

Features an integrated [processing-core][processing-core] but removing troubling proprietary code (ThinkOpen as in free not asinine ThinkDifferent as proprietary) such as `com.apple.eawt.Application` apple.jar and `com.sun.javafx.geom.Path2D` from `javafx`


A slim layer to communicate with Processing from JRuby, features a polyglot maven build. We have created a configuration free version of ruby processing, for processing-3.3.7, where we integrate a modified processing core. This jar is small enough to include in a gem distribution, and hence we do not require configuration. This has created a scriptable version, ie files get run direct from jruby, but you could use jruby-complete if you used the propane script (avoids need to give the absolute data path for the data folder, but would also be needed for a watch mode). See guide to [building ruby-processing projects][building]. It is entirely possible that this version will have degraded performance on Mac (lacking support for dock icons?, close down errors? or strat at all?), but if it works passably well it could be the future on MacOS, else this branch could be re-purposed as pure linux and hence herald possible raspberryPI support.

## Requirements

- jdk8+
- jruby-9.1.17.0
- mvn-3.5.0+ (_build only_)

## Building and testing

```bash
rake
rake gem
rake javadoc
```

## Installation
```bash
jgem install propane --pre # from rubygems
jgem install propane-2.8.1.pre-java.gem # local install

```

## Usage

``` ruby
require 'propane'

class FlashingLightsSketch < Propane::App

  def settings
    size(800, 600)
  end

  def setup
    sketch_title 'Flashing Light Sketch'
  end

  def draw
    background(rand(255), rand(255), rand(255))
  end
end

FlashingLightsSketch.new
```


There is a handy sketch creator tool
```bash
propane -c my_sketch 200 200 # for default renderer
propane -c my_sketch 200 200 p2d # for opengl 2D renderer
propane -c my_sketch 200 200 p3d # for opengl 3D renderer
```

To run sketches

```bash
jruby my_sketch.rb # or use script to run sketches from atom
```
To install the sound and video libraries `~/.propane/libraries`. Depends on wget.
```bash
propane --install sound
propane --install video
```
Other java libraries can be manually installed to the same folder (no need for processing ide)

See [gh-pages][gh-pages] for more detailed instructions and much more.

## Examples

[Worked Examples](https://github.com/ruby-processing/propane-examples) more to follow, feel free to add your own, especially ruby-2.2+ syntax now we can. To install the samples.  The samples get copied to `~/propane_samples`. Depends on wget.
```bash
propane --install samples
```
 please move existing `propane_samples` if you wish to keep them. The current release features several PixelFlow glsl library examples, including a few shadertoy demos as sketches.
