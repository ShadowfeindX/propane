title: Guide to libraries in propane
---
It is possible to use vanilla [processing libraries][processing] with propane, but we also provide pure ruby libraries eg `boids`.  Most libraries can be loaded using the [load_library][load_library] method, the exception being those that can be loaded as [gems][gems]. It is also possible use the [load_library][load_library] method to load local libraries for your sketches see [raining.rb][raining], if you stick with propane library conventions. For more advanced sketches it is good idea to create your own [libraries][libraries].

{% for library in site.libraries %}
	<div class="library">
		<h2><a href="{{ library.url | prepend: site.github.url }}">{{ library.title }}</a></h2>
	</div>
{% endfor %}
