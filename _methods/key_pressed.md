title:  "key_pressed"

In vanilla processing [keyPressed][keyPressed] is both a variable and a method, for jruby_art the boolean variable is available as `key_pressed?`, whereas you can create events/operations that occur on key pressed by adding a `key_pressed` method as below:-

{% highlight ruby %}
def key_pressed  
  # code gets executed on key pressed you can access the `key` variable in this loop
  case key
  when 'c', 'C'
  # do stuff when c is pressed
end
{% endhighlight %}

For sketch with `key_pressed` method see [raining][raining], follow link for a sketch using [key_pressed?][key_pressed?].
